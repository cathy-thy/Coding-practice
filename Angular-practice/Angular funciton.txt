1. *ngIf 
    - can be used to check condition 
    - 

2. ng-template
    - on ngif, you can specify else, and put #commentsref there to execute ng-template 

3. ngFor
    - use for iteration
    - can use to load dynamic number of components

4. property binding
    - send data from parent to child
    @Input()
    - productlist (parent) -> productlistitem(child)
        - Child: variable in child component is able to receive the data from parent component only if it is decorated with @input() decorator
        - Parent: in parents template through property binding data can be sent to the child component

5. Send data from child to parent
    - <app-child (nameevent)="receiveName($event)"></app-child>
    - send the value of name into parentcomponent(chilname)
        @Output() namevent = new EventEmitter<string>()

6. Interactive forms
    - In angularm there are 2 approaches to design the interactive forms
        - Template driven approach
            
        - Reactive approach
